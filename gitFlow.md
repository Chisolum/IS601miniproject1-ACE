## Repositories
A git repository is a collection of the files and folders within a project, along with the version and change history of each file. To initialize a repository or to convert an existing unversioned project directory into a Git repository, the  `git init` command can be used. Executing `git init` creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory, which will contain all the necessary Git metadata to track the new repository.

```
git init
```

## Git Clone
`git clone` is used to create a copy of an existing local or remote repository to a local directory. It is useful for developers looking to have a working copy of a repository which can be edited separately from the main repository. The version controls of the clone are managed on the local repository.
Example, 
```
git clone [repository clone address]
```
