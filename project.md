# Project Description

The usage of Git version control system enables developers to collaborate on projects making it easier for multiple developers to work on same or parallel projects improving productivity and data integrity. The integration of Git with Docker accelerates and optimizes these advantages with the added value of managing build, run and portability of applications. Automated testing simplifies much of the manual effort by putting the testing condition into a set of reusable scripts that can run repeatedly at different times, this facilitates Continuous integration practices. Integrating Docker solution into their continuous Integration and delivery practices has helped many companies to improve on system provisioning, reduce job time, increase the volume of jobs run and improve overall infrastructure, ensuring that the such company adapt to changing business environment and continuously improve their productivity and business advantage over competitor.   

**Definitions**  

**Git** - Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.   
**Docker** - Docker is the open platform to build, ship and run distributed applications, anywhere. At the core of the Docker solution is a registry service to manage images and the Docker Engine to build, ship and and run application containers  
**Automated testing** â€“ Automated testing is the act of conducting specific tests via automation (e.g. a set of regression tests) as opposed to conducting them manually, while test automation refers to automating the process of tracking and managing the different tests.   
**Countinous Integration** - Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
