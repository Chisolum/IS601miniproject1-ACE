# CSV Files
CSV(Comma Separated Values) files are used to store a large number of variables or data. They are simplified spreadsheets, like Excel, yet only the content is stored in plaintext. Python CSV module is a built-in function that allows Python to parse this file type.
The text inside the CSV file is laid out in rows, and each of those has columns, all separated by commas. Often times in CSV files, the first row is column names in SQL tables, and then the other rows are the data according to the columns.
Every line in a CSV file is a row in the spreadsheet, while the commas are used to define and separate cells. The commas are crucial because they are a key indicator of the different values/new subset.
