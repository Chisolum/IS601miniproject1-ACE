Methods are members of classes or functions that are available for a given object. It is important to note that all methods are functions, however not all functions are methods. Methods can be defined inside a class definition (called by its names but associated to an object) to create the relationship between the class and the method. 
Methods may or may not return data and can operate on the data/instance variables that is contained by the corresponding class. Here are examples of basic python methods:
