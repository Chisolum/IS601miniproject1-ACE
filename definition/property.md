# Property / Attribute
Attributes are described by data variables for example like name, age, height etc. There can also be two different types of attributes â€“ class vs. instance. Class attributes is a variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object and is shared between all the objects of that particular class.
Properties are special kind of attributes that can have a getter, setter and delete methods like __get__, __set__ and __delete__ methods. You have complete control over these factors, whereas an attribute you do not.
Furthermore, the property allows you to get and set values like you would normal attributes, but underneath there is a method being called translating it into a getter and setter for you.
