# Factory

Factory is a creational design pattern used to create concrete implementations of a common interface, while separating the process of creating an object from the code that depends on the interface of the object.
Ultimately, it solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes and is very useful when performing high level of coding.
It also defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct constructor call (new operator).
