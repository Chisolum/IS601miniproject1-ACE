# Pull Request   

Pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. This lets everybody involved in the project know that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch. Pull requests are also a dedicated forum for discussing the proposed feature. This gives other developers an opportunity to review the changes before they become a part of the main codebase. If there are any problems with the changes, teammates can post feedback in the pull request and even tweak the feature by pushing follow-up commits. All of this activity is tracked directly inside of the pull request.
